Matlab code and data for the Executive-Limbic (EXE-LIM) network

The "FC" folder contains the functional connectivity (FC) matrices for 98 normal control (NC) subjects and 96 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).

The "SC" mat file stores Structure Connectivity data

LEN_NC001.m: This m-script estimate effective connectivity (EC) for the NC001 subject

LEN_MDD001.m: This m-script estimate EC for the MDD001 subject

Model_NEURAL.m: This m-script function calculates neural activity

Model_HEMO.m: This m-script function converts neural activity into BOLD responses
