The MNMI_MDD repository stores the Matlab code and data to estimate (optimize) effective connectivity (EC) in the Default mode-Salience (DMN-SAL) network and the Executive-Limbic (EXE-LIM) network. The detailed method with results can be found in the following paper:

Li et al. (2020) Multiscale Neural Modeling of Resting-state fMRI Reveals Executive-Limbic Malfunction as a Core Mechanism in Major Depressive Disorder. medRxiv, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.20084855    

The DMN-SAL folder contains the code and data for the DMN-SAL network

The EXE-LIM folder contains the code and data for the EXE-LIM network

The Data folder contains Structural Connectivity (SC) for 14 HCP subjects and BOLD time series for 98 normal control (NC) and 96 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Destrieux atlas (164 ROIs) included in FreeSurfer
