Matlab code and data for the Default mode-Salience (DMN-SAL) network

The "FC" folder contains the functional connectivity (FC) matrices for 98 normal control (NC) subjects and 96 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).

The "Visualization" folder contains the code and data to visualize the estimated (optimized) effective connectivity (EC)

The "SC" mat file stores the average Structure Connectivity matrix from 14 HCP subjects for the DMN-SAL and EXE-LIM networks

DSN_NC001.m: This m-script estimate effective connectivity (EC) for the NC001 subject

DSN_MDD001.m: This m-script estimate EC for the MDD001 subject

Model_NEURAL.m: This m-script function calculates neural activity

Model_HEMO.m: This m-script function converts neural activity into BOLD responses
